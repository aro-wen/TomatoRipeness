backup lang just incase... hahaha baka may key na nakakalat rito pero i added these files via upload,,, without the datasets :D

To get the project working on another machine, a user would need to:

Clone the repository
Set up their Kaggle API credentials in ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
Run python setup.py which will download the dataset and set up the environment
